# Grav SCSS Plugin

`SCSS` is a [Grav](http://getgrav.org) Plugin which allows for the dynamic compilation of PHP files.

# Installation

Installing the SCSS plugin can be done in one of two ways. Our GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file. 

## GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install scss

This will install the SCSS plugin into your `/user/plugins` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/scss`.
